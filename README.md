I'm learning JavaScript, specifically React and Node now that I'm pretty proficient in vanilla JavaScript.

Some resources that I like:  
The Coding Train  
Traversy Media  
Code with Ania Kub√≥w  
Ben Awad  
CodeSignal  
LeetCode

I'm also learning Python as well.

Paid courses can be interesting too.

Of course, making projects by myself and looking up things as I need them is my favorite way.  

I also post questions on Stack Overflow from time to time.

I'm learning various algoithms as well.

Let me know if you have any suggestions!

Thank you!
